## Testing PIXI.js for the next Ludum Dare

Ludum Dare is a game development contest where you attempt to make a game within a weekend. You must create all sprites, music, and code from scratch.

You are given a theme once the event begins. The last theme was one room.

### Lessons Learned

From participating lightly on the last Ludum Dare, I learned that you must have some sprites already premade if you want to have a solid game. Otherwise you will be spending alot of time doing the art for your game.

On day one of the last event I spent almost one full day just making art of Donald Trump. I figured since he was the new president he would be trapped in his room with ridiculous requests.

After a full day of artsy stuff, I was totally burnt out. I did the animations on the second day and once I had to start coding in Unity. I forgot how to use Unity. The last time I used Unity was in July or last summer.

### Next time on Ludum Dare

Count me in on the next Ludum Dare.
Be prepared for the next one.
